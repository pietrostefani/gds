abstract="In this chapter, we discuss key concepts for exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). We start with its close relationship to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and introduce different types of spatial data. Then, we discuss how to explore spatial data via different types of maps and via linking and brushing. A key technique for ESDA is local indicators of spatial association (LISA). ESDA needs to be supported by software. We discuss two main lines of software developments: GIS-based solutions and stand-alone solutions.",

abstract="Advances in information technology as well as organizational changes in both the public and private sectors have led to increased availability of small area data. If the benefits of having such data are to be fully realized, we need statistical methods that give rise to parameter estimates with good properties including standard errors reliably estimated. To achieve this goal, four challenges associated with spatial and spatial-temporal data need to be met head-on: spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, data sparsity, and uncertainty. We start this chapter by reviewing each of the four challenges. We then describe spatial statistical modeling drawing a distinction between theory-driven and data-driven modeling. We also compare Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference and argue that Bayesian inference is more appropriate to an observational science. The chapter then discusses the two principal approaches to modeling spatial and spatial-temporal data: spatial econometric and spatial hierarchical regression modeling. While the two approaches are, in many respects, complementary, hierarchical modeling which breaks down complex models into distinct modules offers a number of clear advantages and in combination with Bayesian inference meets the four challenges described at the outset thereby providing a positive answer to the question of whether we can have the best of both worlds: spatial and spatial-temporal precision and statistical precision.",
