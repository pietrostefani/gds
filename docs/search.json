Please make sure to check the student handbook and familiarise with them. In addition to these generic criteria, the following specific criteria will be used in cases where computer code is part of the work being assessed:\n\n0-15: the code does not run and there is no documentation to follow it.\n16-39: the code does not run, or runs but it does not produce the expected outcome. There is some documentation explaining its logic.\n40-49: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is some documentation explaining its logic.\n50-59: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is extensive documentation explaining its logic.\n60-69: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is extensive documentation, properly formatted, explaining its logic.\n70-79: all as above, plus the code design includes clear evidence of skills presented in advanced sections of the course (e.g. custom methods, list comprehensions, etc.).\n80-100: all as above, plus the code contains novel contributions that extend/improve the functionality the student was provided with (e.g. algorithm optimizations, novel methods to perform the task, etc.)."
