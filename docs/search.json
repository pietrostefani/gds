This is course designed and delivered by Dr. Elisabetta Pietrostefani and Dr. Carmen Cabrera-Arnau from the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. Much of the course material is inspired by Dani Arribas-Bel’s course on Geographic Data Science.\nThis module will introduce students to the field of Geographic Data Science (GDS), a discipline established at the intersection between Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Data Science. The course covers how the modern GIS toolkit can be integrated with Data Science tools to solve practical real-world problems.\nCore to the set of employable skills to be taught in this course is an introduction to programming tools. Students will be able to whether to develop their skills in either R or Python in Lab sessions.\nThe website is free to use and is licensed under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International.

Students will complete an essay which combines both code, data visualisation and prose supported by references in order to demonstrate sound understanding of all learning outcomes.\nOverview\nHere’s the premise. You will take the role of a real-world geographic sata scientist tasked to explore datasets on New York City and find useful insights for a variety of city decision-makers. It does not matter if you have never been to New York City. In fact, this will help you focus on what you can learn about the city through the data, without the influence of prior knowledge. Furthermore, the assessment will not be marked based on how much you know about New York City but instead about how much you can show you have learned through analysing data. You will need contextualise your project by highlighting the opportunities and limitations of ‘old’ and ‘new’ forms of spatial data and reference relevant literature.\nWhat is a Computational Essay?\nA computational essay is an essay whose narrative is supported by code and computational results that are included in the essay itself. This piece of assessment is equivalent to 2,500 word. However, this is the overall weight. Since you will need to create not only narrative but also code and figures, here are the requirements:\n\nMaximum of 1,000 words (ordinary text) (references do not contribute to the word count). You should answer the specified questions within the narrative. The questions should be included within a wider analysis.\nUp to four maps or figures (a figure may include more than one map and will only count as one but needs to be integrated in the same overall output)\nUp to one table\n\nThere are three kinds of elements in a computational essay:\n1. Ordinary text (in English)\n2. Computer input (R-markdown or Python code)\n3. Computer output These three elements all work together to express what’s being communicated.\nSubmission (Coming Soon)\nData (Coming Soon)\nSpecifics (Coming Soon)"

    "text": "From Geographic Data Science to Geographic Data Science\nGeographic Information holds a pivotal position within our modern societies, permeating various aspects of our daily lives. It underpins essential sectors such as housing, transportation, insurance, banking, telecommunications, logistics, energy, retail, agriculture, healthcare, and urban planning. Its significance lies in the capacity to analyze and derive invaluable insights from geo-spatial data, enabling us to make informed decisions and address complex challenges. Proficiency in this field equips individuals with the ability to work with real-world data across multiple domains and tackle diverse problems. Furthermore, it provides the opportunity to acquire essential data science skills and utilize important tools for answering spatial questions. Given its wide-ranging applications and the increasing reliance on location-based information, there is a substantial demand for experts in the geographic information industry, making it a highly sought-after skill set in today’s workforce.\nWhat information does GIS use?\n\nData that defines geographical features like roads, rivers\nSoil types, land use, elevation\nDemographics, socioeconomic attributes\nEnvironmental, climate, air-quality\nAnnotations that label features and places\n\nGeographic Data Science\nA GIS person typically produces cartographic and analytical products using desktop software. A geospatial data scientist creates code and runs pipelines that produce analytical products and cartographic representations.\nThis entails working with real-world data from various domains and tackling a wide range of complex problems. Through this process geospatial data science includes both data science and GIS tools that lead to the analysos of intricate spatial questions effectively. The synergy between CyberGIS and Geographic Data Science is unmistakable, with coding playing a pivotal role in enabling the seamless development of interactive data analysis. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and innovative methodologies, this symbiotic relationship enhances the accessibility, scalability, and interactivity of geospatial data analysis. Consequently, it opens up new vistas for collaborative research and decision-making processes.\nThis multifaceted approach equips them with the knowledge and expertise to navigate the intricate world of spatial data analysis and contribute meaningfully to diverse fields where location-based insights are invaluable."

    "text": "Data wrangling\nReal world datasets are messy. There is no way around it: datasets have “holes” (missing data), the amount of formats in which data can be stored is endless, and the best structure to share data is not always the optimum to analyze them, hence the need to munge them. As has been correctly pointed out in many outlets (e.g.), much of the time spent in what is called (Geo-)Data Science is related not only to sophisticated modeling and insight, but has to do with much more basic and less exotic tasks such as obtaining data, processing, turning them into a shape that makes analysis possible, and exploring it to get to know their basic properties.\nFor how labor intensive and relevant this aspect is, there is surprisingly very little published on patterns, techniques, and best practices for quick and efficient data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation. In this session, you will use a few real world datasets and learn how to process them into Python so they can be transformed and manipulated, if necessary, and analyzed. For this, we will introduce some of the bread and butter of data analysis and scientific computing in Python. These are fundamental tools that are constantly used in almost any task relating to data analysis.\nThis notebook covers the basic and the content that is expected to be learnt by every student. We use a prepared dataset that saves us much of the more intricate processing that goes beyond the introductory level the session is aimed at. As a companion to this introduction, there is an additional notebook (see link on the website page for Lab 01) that covers how the dataset used here was prepared from raw data downloaded from the internet, and includes some additional exercises you can do if you want dig deeper into the content of this lab.\nIn this notebook, we discuss several patterns to clean and structure data properly, including tidying, subsetting, and aggregating; and we finish with some basic visualization. An additional extension presents more advanced tricks to manipulate tabular data.\nBefore we get our hands data-dirty, let us import all the additional libraries we will need, so we can get that out of the way and focus on the task at hand:"
