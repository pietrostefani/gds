# __Context__

**Why Spatial analysis with R?**  Because R is an open source environment **made for
data analysis and graphics** that **runs on all platforms**. If we'd use
a closed source environment, we'd miss the opportunity to reproduce and scrutinize
computations and fail to meet the _science_ goal of _Data Science_;
if we'd use a general purpose programming language we would (more)
easily end up in a package installation hell.

# __Spatial data and geometries__

## Special about spatial data

**All data is spatial** - data comes from observation, and
observation needs to happen _somewhere_ and at _some time_.
This makes all data spatial. For a lot of data, the location
expressed in spatial, Earth-bound coordinates of observation is
not of prime importance:

* if a patient undergoes a brain scan, the location of the scanner
is not important; the location of the person relative to the
scanner is
* if a person receives a positive COVID-19 test result, the location
of testing may not be important for the person's decision on whether
to go into quarantine or not
* for someone trying to do contact tracing, this person's location
history may be most relevant, however

## Open Source GIS

**Open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, such as **QGIS**, have made 
geographic analysis accessible worldwide. 
GIS programs tend to emphasize graphical user interfaces (GUIs), 
with the unintended consequence of discouraging reproducibility (although many 
can be used from the command line Python + QGIS).
**R**, by contrast, emphasizes the command line interface (CLI). 

The **‘geodata revolution’** drives demand for high performance computer hardware 
and efficient, scalable software to handle and extract signal from the noise, 
to understand and perhaps change the world. Spatial databases enable storage 
and generation of manageable subsets from the vast geographic data stores,
making interfaces for gaining knowledge from them vital tools for the future. 

R is one such tool, with advanced analysis, modeling and visualization capabilities.

# __Geometry with Simple Features__

Simple features is an open standard developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), a not-for-profit organization. Simple Features is a hierarchical data model that represents a wide range of geometry types. Of 18 geometry types supported by the specification, only 7 are used in the vast majority of geographic research; these core geometry types are fully supported by the R package sf (Pebesma 2018).

sf represents all common vector geometry types (raster data classes are not supported by sf):
* points
* lines
* polygons
* and their respective "multi" versions (which group entities of the same type into a single entity).

## Geometries

The basis of every type of geometry is the point. A point is simply a coordinate in 2D, 3D or 4D space (see thumbnail("sf1") for more information) such as:

\index{sf!point}

- `POINT (5 2)`

\index{sf!linestring}
A line string is a sequence of points with a straight line connecting the points, for example:

- `LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)`


A polygon is a sequence of points that form a closed ring without intersection. Closed means that the first and the last point of a polygon have the same coordinates:

- `POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5))`

A polygone with a hole: `POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4))`
\index{sf!hole}

All types of objects:

```{r sfcs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of point, linestring and polygon geometries.", fig.asp=0.4}
library(sf)
old_par = par(mfrow = c(1, 3), pty = "s", mar = c(0, 3, 1, 0))
plot(st_as_sfc(c("POINT(5 2)")), axes = TRUE, main = "POINT")
plot(st_as_sfc("LINESTRING(1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)"), axes = TRUE, main = "LINESTRING")
plot(st_as_sfc("POLYGON((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5))"), col="gray", axes = TRUE, main = "POLYGON")
par(old_par)
```

```{r polygon_hole, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", eval=FALSE}
# not printed - enough of these figures already (RL)
par(pty = "s")
plot(st_as_sfc("POLYGON((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4))"), col = "gray", axes = TRUE, main = "POLYGON with a hole")
```
There are also:
* sets of polygons, `MULTIPOLYGON(((0 0,1 0,1 1,0 0)), ((3 3,4 3,4 4,3 3)))`
* combinations of these `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(0 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1))`- which are inconvenient

## Representing spatial data in R

There are many ways to **handle geographic data in R**, with dozens of packages in the area.
Like many areas of software development, R’s spatial ecosystem is rapidly evolving 
(see Figure 1.2 of https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/intro.html).
Because R is open source, these developments can easily build on previous work.
This approach is advantageous because it encourages collaboration and avoids ‘reinventing the wheel.’ 

Several of the simple R data structures can be used to represent spatial
data, examples are **columns in a data.frame**:

```{r}
head(quakes)
```

**a matrix**
* Elevations of a volcano data-set
* Visualise each of the cells
* Contour lines follow raster cells and see the volcano
* It's just a matrix

```{r}
class(volcano)
volcano[1:5,1:5]
image(volcano)
```

**numeric vectors for polygon coordinates** with `NA` to separate individual rings:
```{r}
library(maps)
m = map(regions="Italy", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)
pols = cbind(m$x, m$y)
dim(pols)
head(cbind(m$x, m$y), 10)
map(regions="Italy")
```

**Task 1:** Change the country - you can have a look at this in your own time https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/maps.pdf

We will shortly see a few more structured approaches to represent
spatial data, using _simple features_, or _rasters_.
First let us look at what coordinates mean.

# __Coordinate reference system__

## Coordinates

With coordinates, we usually think a numbered measured along a ruler,
where the ruler might be an imaginary line: it has an offset (0),
a unit (m), and a constant direction. For spatial data we could have two
imaginary lines perpendicular to each other, and we call this
Cartesian space. Distance between $(x_1,y_1)$ and
$(x_2,y_2)$ in Cartesian space is computed by Euclidean distance:
$$\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$$

The spatial data we just saw, above are _not_ of this kind:

* the raster data (`volcano`) did _not_ have coordinates
* the other examples had coordinates that are **ANGLES**,
  distances along a circle (or ellipsoidal) arc:

```{r out.width='100%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://r-spatial.org/book/02-Spaces_files/figure-html/fig-sphere-1.png")
```
Left: geocentric coordinates (Cartesian, three-dimensional,
units metres); Right: spherical/ellipsoidal coordinates (angles,
units degrees)

Euclidean distances **do not work** for ellipsoidal coordinates:
one degree longitude at the equator is about 111 km, at the poles
it is 0 km.

## What does _coordinate reference system_ mean?

**CRSs** if disregarded can lead to massive problems. 
CRSs allow you to make the right assumptions without having to guess.
They specify what coordinates mean.

"Data are not just numbers, they are numbers with a context" ([Cobb &
Moore](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2975286?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents))

Coordinate reference systems provide the context of coordinates:

* they tell whether the coordinates are ellipsoidal (angles), or derived, projected (Cartesian) coordinates
* in case they are projected, they detail the kind of projection used, so that the
underlying ellipsoidal coordinates can be recovered
* in **any** case, they point out which ellipsoidal model (datum) was used.

Knowing this we can:

* convert between projected and unprojected, or to another projection
* transform from one datum to another
* combine the coordinates with any other coordinates that have a coordinate reference system

## Let’s look at how CRSs are stored in R spatial objects and how they can be set
For this, we need to read-in a vector dataset:
https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/reproj-geo-data.html
Our new object, new_vector, is a polygon representing a world map data (?spData::world). 
CRS in the sf objects is a list of two elements - input and wkt. 
* The input element is quite flexible, and depending on the input file or user 
input, can contain SRID representation (e.g., "EPSG:4326"), CRS’s name (e.g., "WGS84"), 
or even proj4string definition. 
* The wkt element stores the WKT2 representation, which is used when saving the 
object to a file or doing any coordinate operations. Above, we can see that the 
new_vector object has the WGS84 ellipsoid, uses the Greenwich prime meridian, 
and the latitude and longitude axis order. 
In this case, we also have some additional elements, such as USAGE explaining 
the area suitable for the use of this CRS, and ID pointing to the CRS’s SRID - "EPSG:4326".
* Once we know about Coordinate Reference Systems we can start thinking about geometries.

```{r retrieve crs}
library(sf)
st_crs('EPSG:4326') #retrieve coordinate reference system from object
```

Another example:
```{r}
if(!require("spData")) install.packages("spData") # load geographic data
vector_filepath = system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package = "spData")
new_vector = read_sf(vector_filepath)
st_crs(new_vector) # get CRS
```

The st_crs function also has one helpful feature – we can retrieve some 
additional information about the used CRS. For example, try to run:
```{r}
st_crs(new_vector)$IsGeographic # to check is the CRS is geographic or not
st_crs(new_vector)$units_gdal # to find out the CRS units
st_crs(new_vector)$srid # extracts its SRID (when available)
st_crs(new_vector)$proj4string # extracts the proj4string representation
```

In cases when a coordinate reference system (CRS) is missing or the wrong CRS is set,
the st_set_crs() function can be used:

```{r}
new_vector = st_set_crs(new_vector, "EPSG:4326") # set CRS
```

## Projection and transformation
Established CRSs captured by EPSG codes are well-suited for many applications. 
However in some cases it is desirable to create a new CRS, using a custom proj4string.
This system allows a very wide range of projections to be created, as we’ll see 
in some of the custom map projections in this section.

A long and growing list of projections has been developed and many of these can
be set with the +proj= element of proj4strings.31

**the Mollweide projection** is a good choice.
To use this projection, we need to specify it using the proj4string element, 
"+proj=moll", in the st_transform function:

```{r}
world_mollweide = st_transform(world, crs = "+proj=moll")
plot(world["continent"])
```

On the other hand, when mapping the world, it is often desirable to have as 
little distortion as possible for all spatial properties (area, direction, distance). 
One of the most popular projections to achieve as little distortion as possible
is **the Winkel tripel projection** st_transform_proj() from the lwgeom package 
allows for coordinate transformations to a wide range of CRSs.

```{r}
world_wintri = lwgeom::st_transform_proj(world, crs = "+proj=wintri")
plot(world_wintri["continent"])
```
Moreover, PROJ parameters can be modified in most CRS definitions. 
The below code transforms the coordinates to **the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection** 
centered on longitude and latitude of 0.
```{r}
world_laea1 = st_transform(world, 
                           crs = "+proj=laea +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +lon_0=0 +lat_0=0")
plot(world_laea1["continent"])
```

# __Simple Features__

## Basic Map making
As the first vignette explains, **simple feature objects in R** are stored in a data
frame, with geographic data occupying a special column, usually named ‘geom’ or ‘geometry.’ 

```{r}
vignette(package = "sf") # see which vignettes are available
vignette("sf1")          # an introduction to the package
```

We will use the world dataset provided by the spData.
Note that instead of creating a single map, as most GIS programs would, the plot()
command has created multiple maps, one for each variable in the world datasets. 
This behavior can be useful for exploring the spatial distribution of different variables.

```{r}
library(spData)
names(world)
plot(world)
summary(world["gdpPercap"])
```

Basic maps are created in sf with plot(). 
A legend or ‘key’ with a continuous color is produced if the object to be plotted 
has a single variable (see the right-hand panel). 
Colors can also be set with col =

```{r}
plot(world[3:6])
plot(world["gdpPercap"])
```
And we can also use ggplot2
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = world, aes(fill = gdpPercap))
```

The subsequent code chunk combines countries in Africa:
```{r}
world_africa = world[world$continent == "Africa", ]
africa = st_union(world_africa)
```

We can now plot the African continent over a map of the world. 
Note that the first plot must only have one facet for add = TRUE to work. 
If the first plot has a key, reset = FALSE must be used (result not shown):

```{r}
plot(world["gdpPercap"], reset = FALSE)
plot(africa, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

sf’s plot method also has arguments specific to geographic data. expandBB, for example, 
can be used to plot an sf object in context: it takes a numeric vector of length 
four that expands the bounding box of the plot relative to zero in the following order: bottom, left, top, right.
This is used to plot Kenya in the context of Africa, in the following code:

```{r}
kenya = world[world$name_long == "Kenya", ]
plot(st_geometry(kenya), expandBB = c(3, 2, 3, 2), col = "gray", lwd = 3)
plot(world_africa[0], add = TRUE)
```

# __Rasters__

Coverages are tesselations (subdivisions) of space into regions,
where _every_ point can be uniquely assigned to a subregion. 

With `POLYGONS` we cannot do that, as two polygons that share
a boundary cannot tell to which polygon a point on the shared
boundary belongs.

Rasters are _regular_ tesselations, which uniquely subdivide space
into square or rectangular areas (raster cells, or pixels).

## An example of a raster:
* Stars is a package that builds on sf
* Landsat 7 ETM - Satellite
* Data around Olinda, Brazil
* Run ggplot, 6 pans, multi-spectral data (visible and insibile spectrum)

```{r}
library(stars)
library (abind)
(L7 = read_stars(system.file("tif/L7_ETMs.tif", package = "stars")))
ggplot() + geom_stars(data = L7) + facet_wrap(~band) + coord_equal()
```

or simply:
```{r}
plot(L7)
```

## Raster and Terra

For the illustration of terra concepts, we will use datasets from the spDataLarge. 
It consists of a few raster objects and one vector object covering an area of the Zion National Park (Utah, USA). 
For example, srtm.tif is a digital elevation model of this area.
First, let’s create a SpatRaster object named my_rast:

```{r}
if(!require("spDataLarge")) install.packages("spDataLarge", repos = "https://geocompr.r-universe.dev")
library(spDataLarge)
library(terra)
raster_filepath = system.file("raster/srtm.tif", package = "spDataLarge")
single_layer = rast(raster_filepath)
single_layer
plot(single_layer)
```

The crs() function can be used to access CRS information from a SpatRaster object:
```{r}
crs(single_layer) # get CRS
crs(single_layer) = "EPSG:26912" # set CRS
```
Importantly, the st_crs() and crs() functions do not alter coordinates’ values or geometries. 
Their role is only to set a metadata information about the object CRS. 

The SpatRaster class also handles multiple layers, which typically correspond to 
a single multispectral satellite file or a time-series of rasters.

```{r}
multi_raster_file = system.file("raster/landsat.tif", package = "spDataLarge")
multi_rast = rast(multi_raster_file)
multi_rast
```

nlyr() retrieves the number of layers stored in a SpatRaster object:

```{r}
nlyr(multi_rast)
```
