# **OpenStreetMap**
What are the strengths of OSM?

* International
OSM covers the entire world (in varying degrees of detail). It’s unlikely that national statistics agencies for different countries will have much, if any, geospatial data that doesn’t pertain directly to them.

* Open data
OSM allows you to reuse their data, including for commercial purposes, provided you credit them appropriately. This is usually as simple as putting:

* Coverage and accuracy
The map itself is usually comprehensive, meaning it doesn’t leave out any major features. It is also very accurate when you compare it to other sources of map data available online.

## OpenStreetMap in R

Although online resource do not have to be stored files but could be created server-side on the fly,
typical web services for geospatial data create data on the fly, and give access to this through an API.
As an example, data from OpenStreetMap can be bulk downloaded and read locally, 
e.g. using the GDAL vector driver, but more typical a user wants to obtain a small 
subset of the data or use the data for a small query. 

Several R packages exist that query OpenStreetMap data:

* Package OpenStreetMap downloads data as raster tiles, typically used as backdrop or
reference for plotting other features
*  Package osmdata downloads vector data as points, lines or polygons in sf format
*  Package osmar returns vector data, but in addition the network topology (as an igraph object) 
that contains how road elements form a network, and has functions that compute the shortest route

When provided with a correctly formulated API call in the URL the highly configurable 
GDAL OSM driver (in st_read) can read an “.osm” file (xml) and returns a dataset with five layers: 

* points that have significant tags
* lines with non-area “way” features
* multilinestrings with “relation” features
* multipolygons with “relation” features and other_relations.

## Some background on APIs in R
Instead of having to download a data set, APIs allow programmers to request data directly from certain websites through what's called an Application Programming Interface (hence, "API"). Many large websites like Reddit, Twitter and Facebook offer APIs so that data analysts and data scientists can access interesting data.

In this tutorial, we're going to cover the basics of accessing an API using the R programming language. You don't need any API experience, but you will need to be familiar with the fundamentals of R to follow along.

**"API" is a general term for the place where one computer program interacts with another, or with itself.** When you work with web APIs,  two different computers — a client and server — will interact with each other to request and provide data, respectively.

# **A nice background from OpenStreetMap**

``` {r getmap}
# get background map
london_map <- get_map(getbb("London"), maptype = "toner-background", source = "stamen")
plot(london_map)
```

This is useful for plotting other features
``` {r convert}
# Convert into ggmap object - if you wanted to plot other objects on top of it --> See heatmaps Rmd
london_map <- ggmap(london_map, extent="device", legend="none")
```

# **OSM’s Overpass query**

To get started, load the osmdata package and let’s begin drawing a map of bars in a section of central London.

We have to work with **OSM’s Overpass query**. The first thing to do is to specify 
the location in the world that we are interested in mapping using the opq() function. 
There are two ways to do this.

* Specify a named location
* Specify the bounding box for Open Street Map to draw. You do this with two latitude and longitude coordinates which will form the limits of your box.

The first option is the simpler one. The second one is more complex but offers 
more flexibility by essentially saying to Open Street Map: ‘Give me everything within this area’.

The second option is recommended if you are interested in drawing a large or densely-populated area. 
If you request ‘London’ OSM will give you the entire city, which may time out the server request or at any rate provide you with a lot of data that you won’t need.

Exploring
``` {r explore}
available_features() #features
head (available_features ())
```

```{r amenities}
available_tags("amenity") #tags
```

**First option** NOT RECOMMENDED IN THIS CASE - using London 
``` {r first option}
#first option (not recommended in this case)
# do not run
# town <- 'London' 
# location <- town %>% opq()
```

**Second option** using coordinates (recommended)
``` {r second option}
coords <- matrix(c(-0.1,-0.07,51.5,51.52), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2, ncol = 2, dimnames = list(c('x','y'),c('min','max'))) 
location <- coords %>% opq()
```

## Bounding boxes

A bounding box (usually shortened to bbox) is an area defined by two longitudes and two latitudes, where:

Latitude is a decimal number between -90.0 and 90.0.
Longitude is a decimal number between -180.0 and 180.0.
They usually follow the standard format of:

bbox = left,bottom,right,top
bbox = min Longitude , min Latitude , max Longitude , max Latitude 

Overpass is a C++ library that serves OSM data over the web. 
All overpass queries begin with a bounding box, defined in osmdata with the function opq():

I am going to find the extent I want in: http://bboxfinder.com/#0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000
![bboxfinder.com](../Week 8 - OSM/bbox.png)

This is the specific extent I showed above
``` {r specific extent}
location_spec <- opq(bbox = c(-0.091387,51.526391,-0.023280,51.564762)) 
```

While bounding boxes may be explicitly specified for the opq() function, they are more commonly obtained from the getbb() function, which accepts character strings:
```{r London}
bb <- getbb('Greater London, U.K.')
London <- opq(bbox = bb)
```

Note also that getbb() can return a data frame reporting multiple matches or matrices representing bounding polygons of matches:
```{r bounding polygons}
bb_df <- getbb(place_name = "london", format_out = "data.frame")
bb_poly <- getbb(place_name = "london", format_out = "polygon")
```

## Retrieving OSM data
Open Street Map has two attributes to identify things on a map: features and tags.

* A _feature_ is a type of object that can be mapped such as buildings, highways and railways. 
* Features contain various _tags_ that go into more detail about what the feature is. 
For example the natural feature contains the likes of wood, coastline and beach.

**IMPORTANT** - the quality of features and tags will vary greatly according to type of location.
Will probably be very rich in places like London and New York, less in other locations. 
This all depends on the Open Street Map community.

**Building a Query**
Here is a sample query. 
We are using the location that we defined earlier and adding the OSM feature ‘natural’ with the ‘water’ tag. 
Finally the osmdata_sf() function actually requests the data from the server in simple feature (sf) format.
Aa c() is not actually necessary here, but kept it as sometimes you will want to search for more than one tag 
e.g. value = c("water","coastline")

``` {r water}
water <- location_spec %>%
   add_osm_feature(key = "natural", value = c("water")) %>%
   osmdata_sf ()
``` 

The structure of osmdata objects are clear from their default print method, illustrated using the water example:
```{r water 2}
water
```

## Examine your Query
This query returns a list of different types of geospatial data.
Which one is suitable to plot depends on the feature you are interested in. 

* For individual features such as cafes or statues points may be appropriate. 
* For roads it will likely be lines. 
* For lakes it may be polygons or even multipolygons.

In this case it’s the multipolygons that have the best, most useable plot of the River Thames:

``` {r water plot minimal}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = water$osm_multipolygons, fill = 'light blue') + theme_minimal()
``` 
Note: we cannot see the canals.

``` {r water canals}
water2 <- location_spec %>%
   add_osm_feature(key = "water", value = c("canal")) %>%
   osmdata_sf ()

water2
``` 

``` {r canal plot}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = water2$osm_polygons, fill = 'light blue') + theme_minimal()
``` 

``` {r water plot}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = water$osm_multipolygons, fill = 'light blue') +
  geom_sf(data = water2$osm_polygons, fill = '#c6e1e3') + theme_minimal()

``` 

Query different type of features 
``` {r query OSM }
 streets <- location_spec %>%
   add_osm_feature(key = "highway", 
                   value = c("primary")) %>%
   osmdata_sf()
 
 rail <- location_spec %>%
   add_osm_feature(key = "railway", 
                   value = c("rail")) %>%
   osmdata_sf()
 
 parks <- location_spec %>%
   add_osm_feature(key = "leisure", 
                   value = c("park","nature_reserve","recreation_ground","golf_course","pitch","garden")) %>%
   osmdata_sf()
 
``` 
   
**plot** one at a time
``` {r streets plot}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = streets$osm_lines, size = 1.5, color = '#eedede') + theme_minimal()
```

``` {r rail plot}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = rail$osm_lines, color = '#596060', size = 1) + theme_minimal()
```

``` {r parks plot}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = parks$osm_polygons, fill = '#94ba8e') + theme_minimal()
```

And now if you combine them....

``` {r plot all}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = streets$osm_lines, size = 1.5, color = 'orange4') +
  geom_sf(data = rail$osm_lines, color = '#596060', size = 1) +
  geom_sf(data = parks$osm_polygons, fill = 'lightgreen') +
  geom_sf(data = water$osm_multipolygons, fill = 'blue3') +
  geom_sf(data = water2$osm_polygons, fill = 'royalblue') +
  theme_minimal()
```

And if you focus on are of interest
``` {r plot just close-up}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = streets$osm_lines, size = 1.5, color = 'orange4') +
  geom_sf(data = rail$osm_lines, color = '#596060', size = 0.8) +
  geom_sf(data = parks$osm_polygons, fill = 'lightgreen') +
  geom_sf(data = water$osm_multipolygons, fill = 'blue3', colour = "blue3") +
  geom_sf(data = water2$osm_polygons, fill = 'royalblue', colour = "royalblue") +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-0.091387,-0.023280), ylim = c(51.526391,51.564762)) + theme_minimal()
```

**Task 1** - Use https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features#Entertainment.2C_Arts_.26_Culture
to create a map of New York

This can get you started
``` {r extent nyc}
nyc <- opq(bbox = c(-74.0,40.7,-73.9,40.8)) 
#This is a specific extent of NYC, you can chose another if you want, or try with all new york city
```

``` {r parks}
parks <- nyc %>%
   add_osm_feature(key = "leisure", 
                   value = c("park","nature_reserve","recreation_ground","golf_course","pitch","garden")) %>%
   osmdata_sf()
``` 

``` {r parks nyc}
ggplot() + 
    geom_sf(data = parks$osm_polygons, fill = '#94ba8e') + theme_minimal()
``` 

# **A bit more with OSM** 
Objectives: 

* Download data from Open Street Map API
* Create travel time between two points

Application: 

* Travel time from LSE to climbing centres

Exercises: 

* Create the travel time from LSE to climbing centres
* Select the shortest ones

## Build a query

OSM is an extensive database, so as we have scene downloading the entire OSM is not recommended. Once the OSM package is loaded, we can look at the available features. We query the database with our request using an overpass API. Here, I take as an example the climbing gyms in London.

``` {r available_features_q}
head(available_features())
```

They are many ways elements are described in OSM. For a complete list of how features are described, you can visit: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features. Here, we can focus on sport facilities: 

``` {r available_tags}
head(available_tags("sport"))
```

We can now build the query using $opq$ and restricting it to London. 

The request to download everything is below and is not recommended!
``` {r request_everything, eval = FALSE}
q <- opq(bbox = 'London City, U.K.')
lots_of_data <- osmdata_sf(q)
```

Instead, we can query all sport features related to climbing. 
``` {r build_query}
osm_q_sf <- opq("Greater London, U.K.") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "sport", value = "climbing") %>%
  osmdata_sf ()

osm_q_sf  
```

We see that some climbing gyms are described as a polygon, others a point by inspecting the different elements. There are many empty fields we can clean up. 

``` {r filter_results}
# remove all fields with missing values
not_all_na <- function(x) any(!is.na(x))

# inspect the points
osm_pts <- osm_q_sf$osm_points %>%
  filter(leisure== "sports_centre") %>%
  select(where(not_all_na))

str(osm_pts)

# inspect the lines
osm_lines <- osm_q_sf$osm_lines %>%
  filter(leisure== "sports_centre") %>%
  select(where(not_all_na))

str(osm_lines)

# inspect the polygons and use their centroids to get points
osm_polys <- osm_q_sf$osm_polygons %>%
  filter(leisure== "sports_centre") %>% 
  select(where(not_all_na)) %>%
  st_centroid()

str(osm_polys)

# bind the results together as points
osm_results <-  bind_rows(osm_polys, osm_pts)
osm_results #not there is still a lot of missing information
```

Finally, we can plot the result on a map. 

``` {r get_background, results = "HIDE", warnings = FALSE, error = FALSE}
# get background map - we already did this above remember?
london_map <- get_map(getbb("London"), maptype = "toner-background", source = "stamen")
```

``` {r plot_results, echo=FALSE}
# climbing wall map
ggmap(london_map)+
  geom_sf(data = osm_results,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          colour = "red",
          fill = "red",
          alpha = .5,
          size = 4,
          shape = 21)+
  labs(x = "", y = "")
```

However, you have to be careful as OSM might be missing data or tags:

``` {r missing_gyms}
# look for Vauxwall's centres
q <- opq("greater london uk") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "Yonder Climbing")

osm_q_sf <- osmdata_sf(q)$osm_points # This was not included....
```

**Task 2** Modify the script by choosing another type of location through OSM data 
(museums, airports, or whichever other POI you chose that can be queried from OSM) 
to see if you can run this yourself.


# **OSM-Based Routing Service**

OSM has a routing service that can calculate travel time by different modes. 
 
``` {r loadosrm, echo=FALSE}
if(!require("osrm")) install.packages("osrm")
```

We can look for the time between each climbing wall and LSE. But, first, we need to find LSE in OSM.
``` {r findLSE}
q <- opq("greater london uk") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "London School of Economics and Political Science") %>%
  osmdata_sf()
plot(q$osm_multipolygons$geometry)

lse_centre <- q$osm_multipolygons %>% st_centroid()
plot(lse_centre$g, add=TRUE)
```

And then calculate the distance matrix between points.
To this end, we use the OSRM API queries to get travel time matrices between points. 
The function requires to provide a dataframe, SpatialPointsDataFrame, a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame or an sf object. 
It is possible to exclude specific roads (e.g. motorways) and change the modal profile (the default is car, but bike or foot is available).

Argument explanation
* src is a vector of identifier, longitude and latitude (WGS84), a vector of longitude and
latitude (WGS84) or an sf object of the origin point
* dst is a vector of identifier, longitude and latitude (WGS84), a vector of longitude and
latitude (WGS84) or an sf object of the destination point.

``` {r traveltimematrix}
# Travel time matrix with different sets of origins and destinations
distA <- osrmTable(src = lse_centre, dst = osm_results) # osm_results were are climbing walls
head(distA$durations) #prints the different durations

```

The function has returned a list of the travel time between LSE and all the climbing gyms. We can look the minimum travel time and then select in the OSM results the row corresponding to the shortest duration. 

``` {r mindistance}
# find the shortest one
which(distA$durations==min(distA$durations))

# link with name
osm_results[which(distA$durations==min(distA$durations)), "name"]
```

The closest gym is the ice climbing elevator shaft in Ellis Brigham. Not exactly what we were looking for ... 

``` {r maxdistance}
# find the shortest one
which(distA$durations==max(distA$durations))

# link with name
osm_results[which(distA$durations==max(distA$durations)), "name"]
```
And the farthest one doesn't have a name! We would need to see how else to identify them!

**Task 3** Modify the code to look for the time between the points of interest (POI)
to plotted in task 2 and the LSE.


# **Extra: aggregating data and OSM** 
Let's calculate the average population around climbing gyms. First, we need some population data. Then, we can download the census Output Areas for 2011. 
``` {r donwloadoas}
getwd()
# create output folder
dir.create("../GY476_data_2022_23")
download.file("https://data.london.gov.uk/download/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london/9ba8c833-6370-4b11-abdc-314aa020d5e0/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip", destfile = "../GY476_data_2022_23/London/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip")
# unzip
unzip("../GY476_data_2022_23/London/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip", exdir = "../GY476_Files_2021_22/London")

# load 
oas_census <- read_sf("../GY476_data_2022_23/London/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI/OA_2011_London_gen_MHW.shp")

# calculate areas
oas_census$area_census <- st_area(oas_census)

# CHECK OUT what you created
oas_census

# plot
plot(oas_census$geometry)
```

The next step is to create a buffer around the climbing gyms:

``` {r buffer}
# project the data
osm_projected <- st_transform(osm_results, st_crs(oas_census))
# create 150m buffer
buffers150m <- st_buffer(osm_projected, dist=150)
# attach distance
buffers150m$area_buffer <- st_area(buffers150m)
```

``` {r plot}
# load london districts
districts <- read_sf("../GY476_data_2022_23/London/Polygons/districts.shp") %>%
  st_transform(4326)

#plot
map1 <- ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = districts, inherit.aes = FALSE)
map1

#add climbing walls
map1 +  geom_sf(data = osm_results$geometry, inherit.aes = FALSE, colour="#00abff")

# create 500m buffer
buffers500m <- st_buffer(osm_projected, dist=500)
# attach distance
buffers500m$area_buffer <- st_area(buffers500m)

#add climbing wall buffers
map1 +  geom_sf(data = osm_results$geometry, inherit.aes = FALSE, colour="#00abff")+
  geom_sf(data = buffers500m$geometry, fill=NA) 

#zoom in
map1 +  geom_sf(data = osm_results$geometry,inherit.aes = FALSE, colour="#00abff")+
  geom_sf(data = buffers500m$geometry, fill=NA)+
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-0.2,0.0), ylim = c(51.4,51.6)) 
```

And calculate the intersection of the Output Areas. 

``` {r inter}
#create intersection
oas_census <- st_make_valid(oas_census) #can add this in if your R says there is a precision issue
buffers_inter <- st_intersection(buffers150m, oas_census)
buffers_inter$area_inter <- st_area(buffers_inter)
```

Finally, we can aggregate up at the gym level to find the average population living within 150m of a climbing gym: 

``` {r aggregate}
# aggregate at the buffer level
buffers_agg <- buffers_inter %>% 
  mutate(weight = as.numeric(area_inter/area_buffer),
         population = as.numeric(USUALRES)) %>%
  group_by(osm_id) %>%
  summarise_at("population", list(sum = ~sum(. * weight)))
```

The average population is `r round(mean(buffers_agg$sum))`!
