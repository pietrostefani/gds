# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for the "Geographic Data Science" module **ENVS363/563** at the University of Liverpool. This is course designed and delivered by Dr. Elisabetta Pietrostefani and Dr. Carmen Cabrera-Arnau from the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. Much of the course material is inspired by Dani Arribas-Bel's [course on Geographic Data Science](https://darribas.org/gds_course/content/home.html).

This module will introduce students to the field of **Geographic Data Science (GDS)**, a discipline established at the intersection between Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Data Science. The course covers how the modern GIS toolkit can be integrated with Data Science tools to solve practical real-world problems.

Core to the set of employable skills to be taught in this course is an introduction to programming tools. Students will be able to whether to develop their skills in either R or Python in Lab sessions.
