        "In this session, we will further explore the world of geographic data visualization by building upon our understanding of both raster data and choropleths. Raster data, consisting of gridded cells, allows us to represent continuous geographic phenomena such as temperature, elevation, or satellite imagery. Choropleths, on the other hand, are an effective way to visualize spatial patterns through the use of color-coded regions, making them invaluable for displaying discrete data like population density or election results. By combining these techniques, we will gain a comprehensive toolkit for conveying complex geographical information in a visually compelling manner.\n",
