However, *spatial is special* sometimes and there are few aspects in which geographic data differ from standard numerical tables. In this session, we will extend the skills developed in the previous one about non-spatial data, and combine them. In the process, we will discover that, although with some particularities, dealing with spatial data in `Python` largely resembles dealing with non-spatial data.\n",
