        "\n",
        "Points are spatial entities that can be understood in two fundamentally different ways. On the one hand, points can be seen as fixed objects in space, which is to say their location is taken as given (exogenous). In this case, analysis of points is very similar to that of other types of spatial data such as polygons and lines. On the other hand, points can be seen as the occurence of an event that could theoretically take place anywhere but only manifests in certain locations. This is the approach we will adopt in the rest of the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "When points are seen as events that could take place in several locations but only happen in a few of them, a collection of such events is called a point pattern. In this case, the location of points is one of the key aspects of interest for analysis. A good example of a point pattern is crime events in a city: they could technically happen in many locations but we usually find crimes are committed only in a handful of them. Point patterns can be marked, if more attributes are provided with the location, or unmarked, if only the coordinates of where the event occured are provided. Continuing the crime example, an unmarked pattern would result if only the location where crimes were committed was used for analysis, while we would be speaking of a marked point pattern if other attributes, such as the type of crime, the extent of the damage, etc. was provided with the location.\n",
        "\n",
        "Point pattern analysis is thus concerned with the description, statistical characerisation, and modeling of point patterns, focusing specially on the generating process that gives rise and explains the observed data. What's the nature of the distribution of points? Is there any structure we can statistically discern in the way locations are arranged over space? Why do events occur in those places and not in others? These are all questions that point pattern analysis is concerned with.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook aims to be a gentle introduction to working with point patterns in `Python`. As such, it covers how to read, process and transform point data, as well as several common ways to visualize point patterns.\n",

Having learned about visualizing lattice (polygon) data, an option is to \"turn\" points into polygons and apply techniques like choropleth mapping to visualize their spatial distribution. To do that, we will overlay a polygon layer on top of the point pattern, join the points to the polygons by assigning to each point the polygon where they fall into, and create a choropleth of the counts by polygon.\n",

Ideally, we want a boundary delineation that matches as closely as possible the point generating process and partitions the space into areas with a similar internal intensity of points. However, that is usually not the case, no less because one of the main reasons we typically want to visualize the point pattern is to learn about such generating process, so we would typically not know a priori whether a set of polygons match it. If we cannot count on the ideal set of polygons to begin with, we can adopt two more realistic approaches: using a set of pre-existing irregular areas or create a artificial set of regular polygons.

However, it does not get around the issue of the modifiable areal unit problem [M.A.U.P.](https://pietrostefani.github.io/gds/mapvector.html): at the end of the day, we are still imposing arbitrary boundary lines and aggregating based on them, so the possibility of mismatch with the underlying distribution of the point pattern is very real.\n",

        "One way to work around this problem is to avoid aggregating into another geography altogether. Instead, we can aim at estimating the continuous observed probability distribution. The most commonly used method to do this is the so called kernel density estimate (KDE). The idea behind KDEs is to count the number of points in a continious way. Instead of using discrete counting, where you include a point in the count if it is inside a certain boundary and ignore it otherwise, KDEs use functions (kernels) that include points but give different weights to each one depending of how far of the location where we are counting the point is.\n",

KDE’s however are fairly computationally intensive. When you have a large point pattern like we do in the Buenos Aires example (18,572 points), its computation can take a bit long. To get around this issue, you can create a random subset, which retains the overall structure of the pattern, but with much fewer points.

        "Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is an interpolation technique where we assume that an outcome varies smoothly across space: the closer points are, the more likely they are to have the same outcome. To predict values across space, IDW uses neighbours values. There are two main variables: the number of neighbours to consider and the speed of the spatial decay. For example, if we were to model the likelihood of a household to shop at the neighbouring local groceries store, we would need to set a decay such as the probability would be close to 0 as we reach 15 minutes walking distance from home.\n",

This is also called kriging, or Gaussian Process prediction.\n",
