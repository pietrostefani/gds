As has been correctly pointed out in many outlets ([e.g.](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0)), much of the [time](https://twitter.com/BigDataBorat/status/306596352991830016) spent in what is called (Geo-)Data Science is related not only to sophisticated modeling and insight, but to more basic and less exotic tasks such as obtaining data, processing, turning them into a shape that makes analysis possible, and exploring it to get to know their basic properties.\n",

In the example above, we can see how the column index is automatically picked up from the .csv file's column names. For rows, we have specified when reading the file we wanted the column `GeographyCode`, so that is used. If we hadnâ€™t specified any, `pandas` will automatically generate a sequence starting in `0` and going all the way to the number of rows minus one.
