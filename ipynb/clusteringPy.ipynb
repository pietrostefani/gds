        "The dataset we will use in this occasion is an extract from the online website [AirBnb](www.airbnb.com). AirBnb is a company that provides a meeting point for people looking for an alternative to a hotel when they visit a city, and locals who want to rent (part of) their house to make some extra money. The website has a continuously updated list of all the available properties in a given city that customers can check and book through. In addition, the website also provides a feedback mechanism by which both ends, hosts and guests, can rate their experience. Aggregating ratings from guests about the properties where they have stayed, AirBnb provides additional information for every property, such as an overall cleanliness score or an index of how good the host is at communicating with the guests.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original data are provided at the property level and for the whole of London. However, since the total number of properties is very large for the purposes of this notebook, they have been aggregated at the Middle Super Output Area (MSOA), a geographical unit created by the Office of National Statistics. Although the original source contains information for the Greater London, the vast majority of properties are located in Inner London, so the data we will use is restricted to that extent. Even in this case, not every polygon has at least one property. To avoid cases of missing values, the final dataset only contains those MSOAs with at least one property, so there can be average ratings associated with them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal in this notebook is to create a classification of areas (MSOAs) in Inner London based on the ratings of the AirBnb locations. This will allow us to create a typology for the geography of AirBnb in London and, to the extent the AirBnb locations can say something about the areas where they are located, the classification will help us understand the geography of residential London a bit better. This dataset is a good example of the kind of analyses that the data revolution is making possible as, only a few years ago, it would have been very hard to obtain a similarly large survey of properties with ratings like this one. On the other hand, it is important to keep in mind the biases that these data are subject to and thus the limitations in terms of generalising findings to the general population. In any case, this dataset is a great example to learn about statistical clustering of spatial observations, both in a geodemographic analysis as well as in a regionalisation.\n",

The classification is carried out using a statistical clustering algorithm that takes as input a set of attributes and returns the group (\"labels\" in the terminology) each observation belongs to. Depending on the particular algorithm employed, additional parameters, such as the desired number of clusters employed or more advanced tuning parameters (e.g. bandwith, radius, etc.), also need to be entered as inputs. For our geodemographic classification of AirBnb ratings in Inner London, we will use one of the most popular clustering algorithms: K-means. This technique only requires as input the observation attributes and the final number of groups that we want it to cluster the observations into. In our case, we will use five to begin with as this will allow us to have a closer look into each of them.\n",

As we have seen, the essence of this approach is to group areas based on a purely statistical basis: where each area is located is irrelevant for the label it receives from the clustering algorithm. In many contexts, this is not only permissible but even desirable, as the interest is to see if particular combinations of values are distributed over space in any discernible way.

        "Regionalisation is the subset of clustering techniques that impose a spatial constraint on the classification. In other words, the result of a regionalisation algorithm contains areas that are spatially contiguous. Effectively, what this means is that these techniques aggregate areas into a smaller set of larger ones, called regions. In this context then, areas are nested within regions. Real world examples of this phenomenon includes counties within states or, in the UK, local super output areas (LSOAs) into middle super output areas (MSOAs). The difference between those examples and the output of a regionalisation algorithm is that while the former are aggregated based on administrative principles, the latter follows a statistical technique that, very much the same as in the standard statistical clustering, groups together areas that are similar on the basis of a set of attributes. Only that now, such statistical clustering is spatially constrained.\n",
        "\n",
        "As in the non-spatial case, there are many different algorithms to perform regionalisation, and they all differ on details relating to the way they measure (dis)similarity, the process to regionalise, etc. However, same as above too, they all share a few common aspects. In particular, they all take a set of input variables or attributes and a representation of space in the form of a binary spatial weights matrix. Depending on the algorithm, they also require the desired number of output regions into which the areas are aggregated.\n",

In this way, the resulting regions will represent a consistent set of areas that are similar with each other in terms of the ratings received.\n",
