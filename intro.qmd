# Introduction {#sec-intro}

In this section we introduce what Geographic Data Science is. We top it up with a few (optional) further readings for the interested and curious mind.

## From Geographic Data Science to Geographic Data Science

Geographic Information plays a crucial role in our societies 
housing, transportation, insurance, banking, telecommunications, logistics, energy, retail, agriculture, healthcare, urban planning 
Analyse and extract insights from geospatial data
Work with real-world data on a number of domains and problems
Acquire key data science skills and important tools to answer spatial questions + high demand in industry

**What information does GIS use?**
Data that defines geographical features like roads, rivers
Soil types, land use, elevation
Demographics, socioeconomic attributes
Environmental, climate, air-quality
Annotations that label features and places

From the real-world to the GIS world

As a GIS person typically produces cartographic and analytical products using desktop software
Geospatial data scientist creates code and runs pipelines that produce analytical products and cartographic representations.

## **What is *Geographic Data Science*?**

**Philosophy**

Statistician George Box :

*All models are wrong, but some are useful In a similar fashion*.

Geographer Keith Ord :

*All maps are wrong, but some are useful.*

The following clip is taken from a keynote response by Dani Arribas-Bel at the first [Spatial Data Science Conference](https://carto.com/spatial-data-conference/2017/), organised by [CARTO](https://carto.com/) and held in Brooklyn in 2017. The talk provides a bit of background and context, which will hopefully help you understand a bit better what Geographic Data Science is.

1.  The introductory chapter to "Doing Data Science" [schutt2013doing](https://darribas.org/gds_course/content/bA/concepts_A.html#id1), by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt is general overview of why we needed Data Science and where if came from.

2.  A slightly more technical historical perspective on where Data Science came from and where it might go can be found in David Donoho's recent overview [donoho201750](https://darribas.org/gds_course/content/bA/concepts_A.html#id3).

3.  A geographic take on Data Science, proposing more interaction between Geography and Data Science [singleton2019geographic](https://darribas.org/gds_course/content/bA/concepts_A.html#id5).
