## Choropleths

A discrete representation of data
Counterpart of the histogram

	 Both allows us to gage the distribution of a variable

Values are classified into specific colours: value –> bin
Information loss as a trade off for simplicity

Key decision to be made why a given value is a specific colour! 

## Classification choices
N. of bins 
How to bin? 
Colours

How many bins?
Trade-off: detail vs cognitive load
Exact number depends on purpose of the map 
Usually not more than 12 

Your maps should tell a story

## How do we bin? Essentially a statistical problem 

## Equal interval (continuous) 
Take the value span of the data to represent and split it equally
Splitting happens based on the numerical value 
Gives more weight to outliers if the distribution is skewed 


## Quantile
Regardless of numerical values, split the distribution keeping the same amount of values in each bin
Splitting based on the rank of the value
If distribution is skewed, it can put very different values in the same bin 


## Different type of algorithms will optimize for different types of splits 
Fisher-Jenks
Natural breaks
Outlier maps: box maps, std. maps... 

Some involve some fairly fancy statistics

## Colour palette
 Should align with your purpose  

Categories, non-ordered

Graduated, sequential 

Graduated, divergent 
TIP: check ColorBrewer for guidance 

## Tips
Think of the purpose of the map
Explore by trying different classification alternatives
Combine (Geo)visualisation with other statistical devices
