# (Geo)visualisation

## ADD IN IMAGE

“Data graphics visually display measured quantities by
means of the combined use of points, lines, a coordinate
system, numbers, symbols, words, shading, and color.”
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Edward R. Tufte.

## Visualization
By encoding information visually, they allow to
present large amounts of numbers in a meaninful
way.
If well made, visualizations provide leads into the
processes underlying the graphic.
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Edward R. Tufte.

## Geovisualization

## Tufte (1983)
“The most extensive data maps […] place millions of bits
of information on a single page before our eyes. No other
method for the display of statistical information is so
powerful”

## MacEachren (1994)
“Geographic visualization can be defined as the use of
concrete visual representations –whether on paper or
through computer displays or other media–to make spatial
contexts and problems visible, so as to engage the most
powerful human information processing abilities, those
associated with vision.”

## Geovisualization
Not to replace the human in the loop, but to
augment her/him.
Augmentation through engaging the pattern
recognition capabilities that our brain inherently
has.
Combines cartography, infovis and statistics

## A map for everyone
Maps can fulfill several needs, looking very
different depending on the end-goal
MacEachren & Kraak (1997) identify three main
dimensions:
Knowledge of what is being plotted
Target audience
Degree of interactivity

## MacEachren & Kraak (1997)
map cube

## Choropleths

A discrete representation of data Counterpart of the histogram

     Both allows us to gage the distribution of a variable

Values are classified into specific colours: value --\> bin Information loss as a trade off for simplicity

Key decision to be made why a given value is a specific colour!

## Classification choices

N. of bins How to bin? Colours

How many bins? Trade-off: detail vs cognitive load Exact number depends on purpose of the map Usually not more than 12

Your maps should tell a story

## How do we bin? Essentially a statistical problem

## Equal interval (continuous)

Take the value span of the data to represent and split it equally Splitting happens based on the numerical value Gives more weight to outliers if the distribution is skewed

## Quantile

Regardless of numerical values, split the distribution keeping the same amount of values in each bin Splitting based on the rank of the value If distribution is skewed, it can put very different values in the same bin

## Different type of algorithms will optimize for different types of splits

Fisher-Jenks Natural breaks Outlier maps: box maps, std. maps...

Some involve some fairly fancy statistics

## Colour palette

Should align with your purpose

Categories, non-ordered

Graduated, sequential

Graduated, divergent TIP: check ColorBrewer for guidance

## Tips

Think of the purpose of the map Explore by trying different classification alternatives Combine (Geo)visualisation with other statistical devices
