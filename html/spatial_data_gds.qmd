# Data, data, data

-   Everything produces data
-   New dense quantitative representations of the world
-   But data is not useful, insights are

## Data Science

"gathering data messaging it into a tractable form, making it tell its story and presenting that story to others"

<br>

Loukides (2011) What is Data Science?

## Spatial Data Science

-   A lot of new data is spatial data
-   Spatial is special
-   We don't want to reinvent the GIS wheel
-   How do we bring both world together?

# *Good old* spatial data (+)

## *Good old* spatial data (+)

Traditionally, datasets used in social sciences are

- Collected for the purpose (carefully designed)
- Detailed and informative ("rich profile and portraits of the country") 
- High quality

## *Good old* spatial data (-)

But also 

- Massive enterprises (very costly) 
- Coarse in resolution (to preserve privacy they need to be aggregated) 
- Slow - the more detailed, the less frequent they are available

## Examples

-   Decennial census (census geographies)
-   Longitudinal surveys
-   Custom collected surveys, interviews etc.
-   Economic or well-being indicators

# *New Forms* of spatial data

## *New Forms* of spatial data

Tied into the geo-data revolution

-   Accidental : created for different purposes but available for analysis as a side effect

-   Very diverse in nature: resolution and quality but, potentially much more detailed in both space and time

## Lazer & Radford (2017)

-   <mark>Digital life</mark>: digital actions (Twitter, Facebook, WikiPedia...)

-   <mark>Digital traces</mark>: record of digital actions (CDRs, metadata...)

-   <mark>Digitalised life</mark>: nonintrinsically digital life in digital form (Government records, web...)

## Arribas-Bel (2014)

Three levels, based on how they originate:

-   <mark>Bottom up</mark>: "Citizens as sensors"

-   <mark>Intermediate</mark>: Digital businesses/businesses going digital

-   <mark>Top down</mark>: Open Government Data

## Opportunities (Lazer & Radford, 2017)

- Massive, passive 
- Nowcasting 
- Data on social systems 
- Natural and field experiments ("always-on" observatory of human behaviour)
- Making big data small

## Challenges (Arribas-Bel, 2014)

- Bias 
- Technical barriers 
- Methodological "mismatch"

##  Coordinate Reference Systems
Coordinate reference systems provide the context of coordinates:

-   They tell whether the coordinates are <mark>ellipsoidal (angles)</mark>, or derived, <mark>projected (Cartesian)</mark> coordinates
-   In case they are projected, they detail the kind of projection used, so that the underlying ellipsoidal coordinates can be recovered

##  Coordinate Reference Systems

-   Convert between projected and unprojected, or to another projection
-   Transform from one datum to another
-   Combine the coordinates with any other coordinates that have a coordinate reference system
