# (Self-)Quiz

- Have you ever used data to make decisions in your life?
- Have you ever heard the term “Data Science ”?
- Have you ever written a line of computer code?

# Philosophy

::: fragment
- (Lots of) **methods** and techniques
  - General overview
  - Intuition
  - Very little math
  - Lots of ways to continue on your own
- Emphasis on the **application** and **use**
- Close connection to **“real world”** applications
:::

## Philosophy
1. This course is like a gym subsciption
2. Principles over technology
3. Collaborate, do not copy 

# Format

::: fragment
- Concepts: lectures + website + slides, readings
- Hands-on: concepts in (interactive) action
- Do-It-Yourself: practical material to do on your
own

## Code

R or Python

General purpose programming language
Sweet spot between “proof-of-concept” and
“production-ready”
Industry standard: GIS (Esri, QGIS) and Data
Science (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix,
The New York Times, NASA…)

## More Help
This course is much more about “learning to learn
”
and problem solving rather than acquiring specific
programming tricks or stats wizardry
Learn to ask questions (but don
’t expect exact
answers all the time!!!)
Help others as much as you can (the best way to
learn is to teach)
Search heavily on Google + Stack Overflow

## Workflow
Go over the Concepts and Hands-on sections of a
block
2. Get started on the DIY
3. Record questions and post them on Teams prior to
the lab

. Come work on the DIY sections
2. Live answers to questions posted
3. Support from demonstrators and module lead

## Labs
    
- Hands on!
- Collaborate *and* participate
