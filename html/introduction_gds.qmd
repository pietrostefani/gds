# (Self-)Quiz

-   Have you ever used data to make decisions in your life?
-   Have you ever heard the term “Data Science ”?
-   Have you ever written a line of computer code?

# Philosophy

::: fragment
-   (Lots of) **methods** and techniques
    -   General overview
    -   Intuition
    -   Very little math
    -   Lots of ways to continue on your own
-   Emphasis on the **application** and **use**
-   Close connection to **“real world”** applications
:::

## Philosophy

1.  This course is like a gym subsciption
2.  Principles over technology
3.  Collaborate, do not copy

## Format

::: fragment
-   **Concepts**: lectures (website + slides), readings, videos

-   **Hands-on**: concepts in (interactive) action

-   **Do-It-Yourself**: practical material to do on your own

## *Philosophy* of Geographic Data Science

<br> Statistician George Box :

*All models are wrong, but some are useful In a similar fashion*.

<br> Geographer Keith Ord :

*All maps are wrong, but some are useful.*

## Skills

**Hard Skills** - Programming Language - Transparency and Reproducibility - Version control

**Soft Skills** - Communication - Storytelling - Geospatial analytics acumen - Ethical skills

# Open Science

## Command line interface

**Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**

Open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS), exemplified by software like QGIS, have revolutionized the accessibility of geographic analysis on a global scale. However, they inadvertently introduce a challenge to reproducibility.

**Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)**

Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) offer a solution to the reproducibility challenge in GIS.

## The geodata 'revolution’

**Advanced Hardware**: High-performance computer hardware combined with efficient algorithms are driving the geospatial data revolution, allowing us to process vast datasets quickly.

**Scalable Software**: Scalable software solutions are essential for sifting through this data deluge, helping us extract valuable insights from the noise.

**Spatial Databases**: The advent of spatial databases empowers us to store and manipulate manageable subsets within the vast sea of geographic data.

## More Help

This course is much more about *learning to learn* and **problem solving** rather than acquiring specific programming tricks or stats wizardry.

-   Learn to ask questions (but don’t expect exact answers all the time!!!)
-   <mark>Help others</mark> as much as you can (the best way to learn is to teach)
-   Search heavily on <mark>Google + Stack Overflow</mark>

## Workflow

come to the **Lectures**

1.  Go over the Concepts sections of each week after the lecture
2.  Have a look at the Readings and/or videos
3.  Record questions and post them on Teams prior to the lab

## Workflow

come to the **Labs**

1.  Come work through the code and DIY sections
2.  Live answers to questions posted
3.  Support from your lecturers and demonstrators

-   Hands on!
-   Collaborate *and* participate
