# (Self-)Quiz

- Have you ever used data to make decisions in your life?
- Have you ever heard the term “Data Science ”?
- Have you ever written a line of computer code?

# Philosophy

::: fragment
- (Lots of) **methods** and techniques
  - General overview
  - Intuition
  - Very little math
  - Lots of ways to continue on your own
- Emphasis on the **application** and **use**
- Close connection to **“real world”** applications
:::

## Philosophy
1. This course is like a gym subsciption
2. Principles over technology
3. Collaborate, do not copy 

## Format
::: fragment
- **Concepts**: lectures (website + slides), readings, videos
- **Hands-on**: concepts in (interactive) action
- **Do-It-Yourself**: practical material to do on your own

# What is Geographic Data Science?


## Geographic Data Science

<center>![](./figs/gds.png){width="60%"}<center>

## Geographic Data Science

- **Analyse** and **extract** insights from geospatial data
- Work with **real-world data** on a number of domains and problems
- Acquire key **data science skills** and important tools to answer spatial questions 

<center><mark>It is in very high demand in industry.</mark><center>

## *Philosophy* of Geographic Data Science

<br>
Statistician George Box :

*All models are wrong, but some are useful In a similar fashion*.

<br>
Geographer Keith Ord :

*All maps are wrong, but some are useful.*

## More Help
This course is much more about *learning to learn* and **problem solving** rather than acquiring specific programming tricks or stats wizardry.

- Learn to ask questions (but don’t expect exact answers all the time!!!)
- Help others as much as you can (the best way to learn is to teach)
- Search heavily on Google + Stack Overflow

## Workflow

Come to **Lectures**  

Before the lab...

1. Go over the Concepts sections of each week after the lecture
2. Work through the R or Python section of each week (according to your choice of language)
3. Get started on the DIY
3. Record questions and post them on Teams prior to the lab

## Workflow

**Labs** 

1. Come work through the code and DIY sections
2. Live answers to questions posted
3. Support from demonstrators and module lead

- Hands on!
- Collaborate *and* participate
